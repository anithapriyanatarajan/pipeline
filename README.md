## üåô Nightly Releases

This repository supports automated nightly releases that build and publish development images for testing and early feedback. The nightly release system is designed to work with any fork of the Tekton Pipeline repository.

### üöÄ Quick Start for Fork Maintainers

Get started with nightly releases:

1. **Set up GitHub secrets**:
   - `GHCR_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `packages:write` scope
   - `GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: Google Cloud Service Account key for bucket access

2. **Enable the workflow** in your fork's Actions tab

3. **Test your setup**:
   ```bash
   # Manual test run
   gh workflow run "Tekton Nightly Release"
   
   # Check the run status
   gh run watch
   ```

### ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ **Automated builds** every night at 03:00 UTC
- üèóÔ∏è **Multi-platform images** (amd64, arm64, s390x, ppc64le)
- üîç **Basic validation** and health checks
- üì¶ **GitHub Container Registry** publishing
- üîß **Fork-aware** with automatic configuration

### üìö Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **[Setup Guide](docs/nightly-releases.md)** | Complete setup and configuration guide |
| **[CI/CD Integration](docs/cicd-integration.md)** | Simple integration patterns for your workflow |

### üìä What Gets Published

Nightly builds publish these container images to `ghcr.io/{your-username}/pipeline/`:

- `cmd/controller:nightly-YYYYMMDD` - Tekton Pipeline Controller
- `cmd/webhook:nightly-YYYYMMDD` - Admission Webhook  
- `cmd/events:nightly-YYYYMMDD` - Event Handler
- `cmd/resolvers:nightly-YYYYMMDD` - Bundle and Git Resolvers

All images are:
- ‚úÖ Multi-platform (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/s390x, linux/ppc64le)
- ‚úÖ Tagged with date and commit SHA for traceability

The Tekton Pipelines project provides k8s-style resources for declaring
CI/CD-style pipelines.

Tekton Pipelines are **Cloud Native**:

- Run on Kubernetes
- Have Kubernetes clusters as a first class type
- Use containers as their building blocks

Tekton Pipelines are **Decoupled**:

- One Pipeline can be used to deploy to any k8s cluster
- The Tasks which make up a Pipeline can easily be run in isolation
- Resources such as git repos can easily be swapped between runs

Tekton Pipelines are **Typed**:

- The concept of typed resources means that for a resource such as an `Image`,
  implementations can easily be swapped out (e.g. building with
  [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) v.s.
  [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit))

### v1beta1 to v1

Several Tekton CRDs and API spec fields, including ClusterTask CRD and Pipeline
Resources fields, were updated or deprecated during the migration from `v1beta1`
to `v1`.
